# DEFI-COLaF - Theatre-17e

## Pipeline

Don't use the latest versions of python. 3.9 is a safe choice:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3.9 env
```

Install packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run scripts in the order of the numbering.

To run the NER script, you need to download the `final-model.pt` [here](https://huggingface.co/pjox/dalembert-classical-fr-ner/tree/main) and put it in a directory called `models`.
